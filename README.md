# Omedena-MLOps-Course

### Course Description
MLOps concepts will be taught with a real-world case study i.e. estimating daily energy generated from the sun(solar energy) using Abuja city. It will be implemented using Machine Learning and Deep Learning FrameWork.

### Prerequisites
Fundamental knowledge of how to develop and train machine learning and deep learning models.
Some intermediate knowledge of python programming is necessary. And some knowledge of flask or fast API development will be an added advantage.
Basic understanding of cloud computing: cloud storage(s3, azure blob, google cloud bucket), cloud virtual machine instances(ec2, data store ).
